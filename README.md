# DemoWebsites
Demo websites for different research groups applying for a grant. 
It was my first front-end experience back in 2021.
Emmisions website displays data using graphs(chart.js), I added basic dropdowns to change between hardcoded data.
Energy demand website also uses chart.js to show a graph with results of a precompiled simulation for energy demand in chosen zone.
